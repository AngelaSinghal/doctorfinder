## project files are in the brach "my-new-branch" 


This project builds a web application for finding doctors in a specific city based on their domain (e.g., cardiologist, gastroenterologist, ENT specialist). It caters to three user roles:

* **Admin:** Manages the overall system.
* **Hospital:** Registers hospitals within a city.
* **Doctor:** Registers doctors affiliated with a particular hospital and domain.
* **User:** Searches for doctors by domain to find relevant healthcare providers.

**Project Structure:**

* **app:** Contains the core application code (models, routes, logic).
* **migrations:** Stores database schema changes (for a database).
* **static:** Holds static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.
* **templates:** Stores HTML templates used for rendering dynamic content.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* pip (usually included with Python installation)
* A web framework like Flask ([https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/))
* (Optional) A database like PostgreSQL or MySQL (if using database storage)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository: 
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended for managing dependencies):
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies (adjust based on your choices):
   ```bash
   pip install Flask  # (or your chosen web framework)
   # Additional dependencies for database (if applicable)
   ```

**Development Setup:**

1. Open the project directory in your preferred IDE.
2. Configure your web framework (e.g., Flask) and database connection (if applicable) within the application code.
3. Run the application (specific command depends on your web framework). This typically starts a development server at a local address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).

**Functionality:**

* **Admin:**
   - Manages user accounts (admins, hospitals, doctors).
   - May have additional functionalities like system configuration.
* **Hospital:**
   - Registers their hospital within a specific city.
   - Registers doctors affiliated with the hospital, specifying their domain expertise.
* **Doctor:**
   - Creates an account and associates with a registered hospital.
   - Specifies their domain of specialization.
* **User:**
   - Searches for doctors by domain and city.
   - Views details of available doctors, including their associated hospitals.

**Authentication and Authorization:**

* Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access based on roles (e.g., Flask-Login).
* Securely store user credentials (hashed passwords).

**Database (Optional):**

* Consider using a database to store hospital, doctor, and user information for persistence and scalability.
* Popular choices include PostgreSQL and MySQL. Use libraries like SQLAlchemy for database interactions.

**Deployment:**

* For production deployment, consider using a web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI alongside a WSGI server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
* Configure the server to serve the application from the appropriate location (containing the main application file).

**Further Development:**

* Implement advanced search features (e.g., doctor ratings, appointment scheduling).
* Enhance user experience with a polished UI (consider frameworks like Bootstrap).
* Integrate email notifications or appointment booking systems (if desired).

**Contributions:**

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your improvements through pull requests. Adhere to best practices for code formatting and commenting.

**Disclaimer:**

This is a basic structure and implementation outline. You'll need to fill in the specific details of your application logic, database interaction (if applicable), authentication flow, UI design, and error handling in the corresponding code files.
